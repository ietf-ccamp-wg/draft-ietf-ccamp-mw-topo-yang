1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model to describe microwave and
   millimeter-wave radio links in a network topology (hereafter,
   "microwave" is used to simplify the text).  The YANG data model
   describes radio links, supporting carrier(s), and the associated
   carrier termination points [RFC8561].  A carrier is a single link
   providing transport capacity over the air.  It is typically defined
   by its transmitting and receiving frequencies.  A radio link provides
   the transport capacity of the supporting carriers in aggregated and/
   or protected configurations, which can be used to carry traffic on
   higher topology layers such as Ethernet and Time-Division
   Multiplexing (TDM).  The model augments the YANG Data Model for
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies defined in [RFC8795], which is
   based on A YANG Data Model for Network Topologies defined in
   [RFC8345].

   The microwave point-to-point radio technology provides connectivity
   on Layer 0 or Layer 1 (L0/L1) over a radio link between two
   termination points using one or several supporting carriers in
   aggregated or protected configurations.  That application of
   microwave technology cannot be used to perform cross-connection or
   switching of the traffic to create network connectivity across
   multiple microwave radio links.  Instead, a payload of traffic on
   higher topology layers, normally Layer 2 (L2) Ethernet, is carried
   over the microwave radio link.  When the microwave radio link is
   terminated at the endpoints, cross-connection and switching can be
   performed on that higher layer creating connectivity across multiple
   supporting microwave radio links.

   The microwave topology model is expected to be used between a
   Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) and a Multi-Domain Service
   Coordinator (MDSC) [RFC8453].  Examples of use cases that can be
   supported are:

   1.  Correlation between microwave radio links and the supported links
       on higher topology layers (e.g., an L2 Ethernet topology).  This
       information can be used to understand how changes in the
       performance/status of a microwave radio link affect traffic on
       higher layers.

   2.  Propagation of relevant characteristics of a microwave radio
       link, such as bandwidth, to higher topology layers, where it
       could be used as a criterion when configuring and optimizing a
       path for a connection or service through the network end to end.

   3.  Optimization of the microwave radio link configurations on a
       network level, with the purpose to minimize overall interference
       and/or maximize the overall capacity provided by the links.

2.2.  Relationship between Radio Links and Carriers

   A microwave radio link is always an aggregate of one or multiple
   carriers in various configurations or modes.  The supporting carriers
   are identified by their termination points and are listed in the
   container-bundled links as part of the te-link-config in the YANG
   Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies [RFC8795] for a
   radio-link.  The exact configuration of the included carriers is
   further specified in the rlt-mode container (1+0, 2+0, 1+1, etc.) for
   the radio-link.  Appendix A includes JSON examples of how such a
   relationship can be modeled.

2.3.  Relationship with Client Topology Model

   A microwave radio link carries a payload of traffic on higher
   topology layers, normally L2 Ethernet.  The leafs supporting-network,
   supporting-node, supporting-link, and supporting-termination-point in
   the generic YANG module for Network Topologies [RFC8345] are expected
   to be used to model a relationship or dependency from higher topology
   layers to a supporting microwave radio link topology layer.
   Appendix A includes JSON examples of an L2 Ethernet link transported
   over one supporting microwave link.

2.4.  Applicability of the Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE)
      Topologies

   Since microwave is a point-to-point radio technology, a majority of
   the leafs in the Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies
   [RFC8795] augmented by the microwave topology model are not
   applicable.  Examples of which leafs are considered applicable can be
   found in Appendices A and B in this document.

   In the more specific context of the microwave-specific augmentations
   of te-topology, the admin-status, and oper-status leafs (from te-
   topology) are only applicable to microwave carriers (in the mw-link
   tree); they are not applicable to microwave radio links.  Radio links
   are instead enabled or disabled in the constituent carriers.
   Furthermore, the status leafs related to mw-tp can be used with
   inter-domain links and when the status of only one side of the link
   is known.  However, since microwave is a point-to-point technology
   where both ends normally belong to the same domain, it is not
   expected to be applicable in normal cases.

3.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The YANG module specified in this document imports and augments the
   ietf-network and ietf-network-topology models defined in [RFC8345].
   The security considerations from [RFC8345] are applicable to the
   module in this document.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes can be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  rlt-mode: A malicious client could attempt to modify the mode in
      which the radio link is configured and, thereby, change the
      intended behavior of the link.

   *  tx-frequency and channel-separation: A malicious client could
      attempt to modify the frequency configuration of a carrier, which
      could modify the intended behavior or make the configuration
      invalid and, thereby, stop the operation of it.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688] as
   follows:

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
   Registrant Contact:  The IESG
   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA has recorded the YANG module names in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020] as follows:

   Name:  ietf-microwave-topology
   Maintained by IANA?:  N
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
   Prefix:  mwt
   Reference:  RFC 9656

                  Figure 3: Example for L2 over Microwave

A.1.  Instance Data for 2+0 Mode for a Bonded Configuration

   An L2 network with a supporting microwave network, showing a 2+0
   microwave configuration is provided below.  The num-bonded-carriers =
   2, and the num-protecting-carriers = 0.  This means both carriers are
   active, so there is no redundancy and there is more capacity.  The
   JSON encoding of the 2+0 example data follows:

Appendix B.  Microwave Topology Model with Example Extensions

   This non-normative appendix provides examples of how the Microwave
   Topology Model can be used with the interface reference topology
   (ifref) [YANG-IF-REF-TOPO] and the bandwidth-availability-topology
   (bwa) [YANG-BWA-TOPO] models.  There is also a snippet of JSON to
   show geolocation information instance data.  When the JSON files have
   long lines, the long lines are wrapped as described in [RFC8792].

   The tree below shows an example of the relevant leafs for a complete
   Microwave Topology Model including interface reference topology
   (ifref) [YANG-IF-REF-TOPO] and bandwidth-availability-topology (bwa)
   [YANG-BWA-TOPO] models.

             Figure 4: Microwave Topology with Extensions Tree

   Microwave is a transport technology that can be used to transport
   client services, such as L2 Ethernet links.  When an L2 link is
   transported over a single supporting microwave radio link, the
   topologies could be as shown below.  Note that the figure just shows
   an example: there might be other possibilities to demonstrate such a
   topology.  The example of the instantiation encoded in JSON is using
   only a selected subset of the leafs from the L2 topology model
   [RFC8944].  The example below uses Figure 3 and adds the interface-
   related information.

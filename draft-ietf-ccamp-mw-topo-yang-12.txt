1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model to describe topologies of
   microwave/millimeter wave (hereafter microwave is used to simplify
   the text).  The YANG data model describes radio links, supporting
   carrier(s) and the associated termination points [RFC8561].  A
   carrier is a description of a link providing transport capacity over
   the air by a single carrier.  It is typically defined by its
   transmitting and receiving frequencies.  A radio link is a link
   providing the aggregated transport capacity of the supporting
   carriers in aggregated and/or protected configurations, which can be
   used to carry traffic on higher topology layers such as Ethernet and
   TDM.  The model augments "YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering
   (TE) Topologies" defined in [RFC8795], which is based on "A YANG Data
   Model for Network Topologies" defined in [RFC8345].

   The microwave point-to-point radio technology provides connectivity
   on Layer 0 / Layer 1 (L0/L1) over a radio link between two
   termination points, using one or several supporting carriers in
   aggregated or protected configurations.  That application of
   microwave technology cannot be used to perform cross-connection or
   switching of the traffic to create network connectivity across
   multiple microwave radio links.  Instead, a payload of traffic on
   higher topology layers, normally Layer 2 (L2) Ethernet, is carried
   over the microwave radio link and when the microwave radio link is
   terminated at the endpoints, cross-connection and switching can be
   performed on that higher layer creating connectivity across multiple
   supporting microwave radio links.

   The microwave topology model is expected to be used between a
   Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) and a Multi Domain Service
   Coordinator (MDSC) [RFC8453].  Examples of use cases that can be
   supported are:

   1.  Correlation between microwave radio links and the supported links
       on higher topology layers (e.g., an L2 Ethernet topology).  This
       information can be used to understand how changes in the
       performance/status of a microwave radio link affect traffic on
       higher layers.

   2.  Propagation of relevant characteristics of a microwave radio
       link, such as bandwidth, to higher topology layers, where it
       could be used as a criterion when configuring and optimizing a
       path for a connection/service through the network end to end.

   3.  Optimization of the microwave radio link configurations on a
       network level, with the purpose to minimize overall interference
       and/or maximize the overall capacity provided by the links.

2.2.  Relationship between radio links and carriers

   A microwave radio link is always an aggregate of one or multiple
   carriers, in various configurations/modes.  The supporting carriers
   are identified by their termination points and are listed in the
   container bundled-links as part of the te-link-config in the YANG
   Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies [RFC8795] for a
   radio-link.  The exact configuration of the included carriers is
   further specified in the rlt-mode container (1+0, 2+0, 1+1, etc.) for

   the radio-link.  Appendix A includes JSON examples of how such a
   relationship can be modelled.

2.3.  Relationship with client topology model

   A microwave radio link carries a payload of traffic on higher
   topology layers, normally L2 Ethernet.  The leafs supporting-network,
   supporting-node, supporting-link, and supporting-termination-point in
   the generic YANG module for Network Topologies [RFC8345] are expected
   to be used to model a relationship/dependency from higher topology
   layers to a supporting microwave radio link topology layer.
   Appendix A includes JSON examples of an L2 Ethernet link transported
   over one supporting microwave link.

2.4.  Applicability of the Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE)
      Topologies

   Since microwave is a point-to-point radio technology, a majority of
   the leafs in the Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies
   augmented by the microwave topology model are not applicable.  An
   example of which leafs are considered applicable can be found in
   appendices Appendix A and Appendix B in this document.

   More specifically in the context of the microwave-specific
   augmentations of te-topology, admin-status and oper-status leafs
   (from te-topology) are only applicable to microwave carriers (in the
   mw-link tree) and not microwave radio links.  Enable and disable of a
   radio link is instead done in the constituent carriers.  Furthermore
   the status leafs related to mw-tp can be used when links are inter-
   domain and when the status of only one side of the link is known, but
   since microwave is a point-to-point technology where both ends
   normally belong to the same domain it is not expected to be
   applicable in normal cases.

3.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The YANG module specified in this document imports and augments the
   ietf-network and ietf-network-topology models defined in [RFC8345].
   The security considerations from [RFC8345] are applicable to the
   module in this document.

   There are a several data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes can be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  rlt-mode: A malicious client could attempt to modify the mode in
      which the radio link is configured and thereby change the intended
      behavior of the link.

   *  tx-frequency, rx-frequency and channel-separation: A malicious
      client could attempt to modify the frequency configuration of a
      carrier which could modify the intended behavior or make the
      configuration invalid and thereby stop the operation of it.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688] as follows:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   It is proposed that IANA record the YANG module names in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] as follows:

       Name: ietf-microwave-topology
       Maintained by IANA?: N
       Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
       Prefix: mwt
       Reference: RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Microwave Topology Model with base topology models

   This appendix provides some examples and illustrations of how the
   Microwave Topology Model can be used.  The tree illustrates an
   example of a complete Microwave Topology Model including the relevant
   data nodes from network-topology and te-topology (base topology
   models).  There are also JSON based instantiations of the Microwave
   Topology Model for a couple of small network examples.

   The tree below shows an example of the relevant leafs for a complete
   Microwave Topology Model including the augmented Network Topology
   Model defined in [RFC8345] and the Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Topologies model defined in [RFC8795].

                  Figure 3: Example for L2 over microwave

A.1.  Instance data for 2+0 mode for a bonded configuration

   A L2 network with a supporting microwave network, showing a 2+0
   microwave configuration.  The num-bonded-carriers = 2 and the num-
   protecting-carriers = 0 which means both carriers are active so there
   is no redundancy but there is more capacity.  The JSON encoding of
   the 2+0 example data follows:

A.2.  Instance data for 1+1 mode for a protected configuration

   A L2 network with a supporting microwave network, showing a 1+1
   microwave configuration.  The num-bonded-carriers = 1 and the num-
   protecting-carriers = 1 which means there is a standby carrier
   protecting the active carrier.  The JSON encoding of the 1+1 example
   data follows:

Appendix B.  Microwave Topology Model with example extensions

   This non-normative appendix provides examples of how the Microwave
   Topology Model can be used with the interface reference topology
   (ifref) [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-if-ref-topo-yang] and the bandwidth-
   availability-topology (bwa) [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-bwa-topo-yang]
   models.  There is also a snippet of JSON to show geolocation
   information instance data.  When the JSON files have long lines,
   [RFC8792] is used to wrap the long lines.

   The tree below shows an example of the relevant leafs for a complete
   Microwave Topology Model including interface reference topology
   (ifref) [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-if-ref-topo-yang] and bandwidth-
   availability-topology (bwa) [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-bwa-topo-yang]
   models.

   Microwave is a transport technology which can be used to transport
   client services, such as L2 Ethernet links.  When an L2 link is
   transported over a single supporting microwave radio link, the
   topologies could be as shown below.  Note that the figure just shows

   an example, there might be other possibilities to demonstrate such a
   topology.  The example of the instantiation encoded in JSON is using
   only a selected subset of the leafs from the L2 topology model
   [RFC8944].  The example below uses Figure 3 and adds the Interface
   related information.
